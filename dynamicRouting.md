## Dynamic Routing

### Types of Dynamic Routing Protocols:

- **IGP** (Interior Gateway Protocol): Used to share routes in between a single autonomous system (i.e a company).
- **EGP** (Exterior Gateway Protocol): Used to share routes between different autonomous system.

| Property      | IGP                                 | EGP                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Algorithm** | 1. Distance Vector (RIP and EIGRP)  | 1. Path Vector (BGP) |
|               | 2. Link State (OSPF(imp) and IS-IS) |                      |
